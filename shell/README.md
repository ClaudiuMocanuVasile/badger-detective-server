This folder contains some shell scripts to call the python parser script and
maybe other uses in the future

the prices from emag.ro, it calls the python script for the links in the "emag_link.txt"
file
* get_price.sh - a simple shell script that parse an html page from emag.ro and
display the information we are looking for
